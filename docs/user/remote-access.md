# Remote access

Connect a phone, browser, or another desktop app to T3 Code running on a different
machine. That machine must stay running and reachable while you work.

## Pair over a LAN or private network

Use direct pairing when the other device can reach the host's network address.

On a desktop host, open **Settings → Connections**, enable **Network access**,
then create a pairing link using an address the other device can reach. Changing
network access restarts the desktop app. You can turn it off in the same place.

For a command-line host, replace `<private-ip>` with the host's LAN
address:

```bash
t3 serve --host <private-ip>
```

If a server is already running, generate a fresh link without restarting it:

```bash
t3 pair
```

Scan the QR code on your phone or paste the pairing URL into **Add environment**
in the receiving app. Connection settings are under **Settings → Connections**
on web and desktop and **Settings → Environments** on mobile. A loopback address
such as `127.0.0.1` reaches only the device opening the link.

Pairing authorizes that device for future connections. Use a fresh one-time link
for each new device; you do not need the original token to reconnect. Links
created in Settings can only be copied from the client that created them while
its Connections page stays open. If you leave or reload that page, create
another link to share.

### Reach one machine several ways

A machine can have more than one route: LAN, a public URL, or SSH. To add one,
choose **Add route** in the machine's route list. Pairing the same machine again over another
address also adds a route instead of a second machine. A new route is placed by
speed, in that order, and you can reorder routes at any time.

While connected through a paired address, T3 Code also learns the
machine's current LAN addresses and adds them as routes. When the
machine's LAN address changes, for example after it joins another Wi-Fi network,
the learned route follows it. The machine must allow network access for its LAN
address to be learned. You can reorder a learned route, but not remove it; it
goes away with the route it was learned through, or when the machine stops
reporting that address.

T3 Code connects over the first route that answers. Away from home, a LAN
address that does not answer is checked briefly and skipped. It is only tried
again, after the other routes, if none of them connect. While connected over a
later route, T3 Code checks the earlier ones when your network changes, when you
return to the app, and every minute, and moves back as soon as one works.

On web and desktop, select the route count under the machine's name in
**Settings → Connections** to see its routes. Drag a route to change the order,
or remove it. On mobile, open the machine under **Settings → Environments** and
choose **Edit**.

### Balance new threads across machines

Auto balance is off by default. On web and desktop, enable it in
**Settings → Connections → Load balancing** to automatically choose a machine for
new threads in projects grouped across connected environments. The section
appears once two or more machines are switched on.
Each machine starts at **Normal**. Choose **Prefer** to favor it when it has CPU and
memory available, **Less often** to reduce its share, or **Manual only** to exclude
it from automatic selection. These are preferences, not fixed traffic percentages.
Preferences are saved separately in each client.

The composer checks eligible machines when choosing a draft's environment, then keeps
that choice stable. Choose **Auto balance** again to check current resources, or choose
a specific machine to override it. Choosing a branch or worktree also keeps the draft
on that machine. Existing threads stay where they started. If resource checks are
unavailable or all eligible machines are full, choose a machine manually to continue.
Mobile keeps its manual environment selection.

## Desktop-managed SSH

In the desktop app, open **Settings → Connections → Add environment**, choose
**SSH**, and enter a host or SSH alias such as `user@example.com`. T3 Code starts
or reuses a server there and opens the port forward for you. Projects, provider
credentials, and agent work stay on the remote machine.

The remote host must be Linux or an Apple Silicon Mac with `curl` or `wget`,
`tar`, `sha256sum` or `shasum`, and [provider setup](./install.md#providers).
The first launch downloads T3 Code's server to `~/.t3code-pe/runtime` on the host, so
it takes longer than later ones.
Provider CLIs must be on the `PATH` of a non-interactive login shell there;
check with:

```bash
ssh user@example.com 'sh -lc "command -v claude codex"'
```

If SSH reconnecting fails after an app update, retry the launch once. Removing
the connection stops a server that T3 Code launched; a server that was already
running is left alone.

[remote sign-in](./providers-antigravity.md#sign-in-from-a-remote-device).

## Browser on a remote environment

Browser tabs belong to the environment, so you and your agents see the same
tabs from any device. The desktop app shows its own environment's tabs
directly. Every other device, and the desktop app for other environments,
streams them from the host. Agents keep using them while no device is
connected, and `localhost` addresses reach servers on the host.

The first tab downloads a headless Chrome, about 120 MB, into the T3 home. It
is the same browser [HTML renders](html-renders.md) use, so a host downloads it
only once. Some Linux hosts need [setup](#browser-host-setup) before it can
start.

Agent tabs have separate storage and share a Chromium process. Take control before
typing into an agent's tab, then release control when you want the agent to
continue. Read-only connections can watch without changing the page.

While you have control, the tab works with your device: text the page copies or
cuts goes to your clipboard, a file picker on the page opens your device's
picker, and a finished download is offered for you to save. Popups such as
sign-in windows open as their own tabs. Downloads stay on the host until the
tab closes. Audio does not play on your device.

On a phone, tap the floating preview's corner dot to show its controls, then
**Pop into separate window** to keep watching in picture-in-picture over other
apps.

### Browser host setup

macOS, Windows, and Linux desktops run the browser as is. Some Linux hosts need
one-time setup: Ubuntu 23.10 and later block the sandbox the browser runs in,
and minimal images and containers lack libraries it loads. When that happens,
the server says so at startup, and browser tabs and HTML previews show the
command to run on the host:

```sh
sudo t3 browser setup
```

The server shows the exact line for how you started it, such as
`sudo npx t3 browser setup`, and keeps your `PATH` when Node is installed only
for your user. Where `t3` is not on your `PATH`, such as with only the
desktop app installed, it names the full path of the app's own `t3` instead. It allows Chrome's sandbox with an AppArmor profile and installs
any missing libraries with apt. It is safe to run again. Without `sudo`, it
only reports what it would change.

The browser always runs in Chrome's sandbox. Where you cannot change the host,
set `T3CODE_SERVER_BROWSER_SANDBOX=0` for the environment to run without it.

## Connect an outside agent

Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT and other agents T3 Code did not start can drive
threads on an environment through its MCP server. See
[outside agents](./outside-agents.md) for setup.

## Manage or revoke access

On the host, **Settings → Connections** lets authorized administrators create
pairing links and revoke client sessions. Revoking an unused link prevents new
pairings; revoke a device's session to remove its existing access. Command-line
management is available through `t3 auth --help`.

A session with an open connection stays listed after its access credential
expires.

To choose a token's permissions, pass `--scope` once for each scope you want:

```sh
npx t3 pair --scope orchestration:read --scope terminal:read
```

The selected scopes replace the default permissions. The same option works with
`npx t3 auth pairing create` and `npx t3 auth session issue`; each command's
`--help` lists the available scopes. Without `--scope`, pairing tokens retain
standard client permissions and issued bearer sessions retain administrative
permissions.

To change an existing client's permissions, create a fresh pairing link with the
scopes it needs. In a browser opened directly on the environment, open that link
to replace the browser's current grant. For mobile or a saved remote environment
in web or desktop, use **Add Environment** with the fresh link or code; pairing
the same environment replaces its saved grant. Reconnecting alone does not change
permissions.

Grouping checkouts does not combine their permissions. Shared project settings
require `orchestration:operate` on every member environment; actions on one
checkout use that checkout's permissions.

`source-control:write` covers direct Git and pull request changes made from the
client: pushing, switching or creating branches, cloning, and removing
worktrees. It does not restrict what a task does. Starting a task in a new
worktree still creates that branch and worktree with `orchestration:operate`,
and the agent it runs can use Git however the environment allows.

Settings changes, provider management, and environment maintenance can be granted
separately from access administration. New standard pairings include these
permissions. Existing clients can stay connected after an update, but newly separated
features may require pairing again with the permissions they need. Older clients
may show controls that the server denies. Create a fresh pairing link to change
a client's permissions.

`filesystem:read` allows browsing host files, opening workspace files, and viewing
local changes. Add `filesystem:write` to allow editing files or saving plans to
the workspace. These scopes control direct file access from the client.

Treat pairing URLs and authorization codes as passwords.

If the environment appears offline, run `t3 service status` and read the displayed log. If it
disappears when SSH closes, see
[background-service troubleshooting](./background-service.md#troubleshooting). For server
version warnings, follow [Updating T3 Code](./updating.md). Do not include them in
screenshots, logs, or bug reports.

## Using the Desktop App as a Remote Only

If a computer should only drive work running elsewhere, turn off its local environment. In the
desktop app, open **Settings → Connections** and switch off **Local
environment**. T3 Code restarts without a local server: no local agents or terminals run, WSL
backends stay off, and other devices can no longer connect to this computer. Your projects,
history, and saved connections are kept, and you keep working through pairing or SSH.

Switch **Local environment** back on in the same place to restart with your previous local
settings.
